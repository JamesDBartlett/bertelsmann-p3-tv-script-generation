Since I have a Google Colab Pro account, I decided to use that for this project, so I wouldn't burn up my GPU hours in the Udacity Workspace.
If you want to run it in the Udacity workspace, you'll need to change the first few code blocks and point them at the files in their locations in the workspace, rather than at the mounted Google Drive, which is where they are pointed now. 

If you'd like to try running it in Google Colab, here's the link:

If you do decide to run it in Colab, you'll notice that the links to the setup files point to my personal Google Drive, so you'll need to copy the files to your own Google Drive, and point the links there.
